Join us for another DEF CON adventure! After 10 years of providing a space to explore and learn about hardware, we’re rebooting to bring you more hardware hacking awesomeness.

We are located in the Caesars Palace Village area this year. We are sharing a (very) large space with the new Soldering Skills Village, and the Badge Maker’s Community Area. This puts all of your hardware hacking/making resources in one place.

For more details on hours and other events, see the [schedule](/schedule.html) page.
