Have you taken your IoT toaster and created a remote activated fire-alarm tester? How about that old toy your kids (right, it was for the kids?) don't play with anymore that now fuzzes your neighbor's drone? Or what about putting that con badge to good use? These all great! The Hardware Hacking Village is hosting a "Make Your 0wn Use" contest. This is the place to show off your skills at repurposing the electronics that surround and engulf us daily.

#### Submissions will require the following details:
1. team handle
2. project name
3. MYOU category: a) repairing a closed device b) adding an unintended feature to a device c) bypassing DRM d) other (describe and justify)
4. describe the device before you made your own use
5. describe why you made your own use
6. describe the device after you have made your own use
7. describe how you made the modifications (links to project log with photos would be best)
8. And of course the end product: bring it for judge inspection at DEF CON 30

#### The scoring will be based on the following:
- How bent / changed / different / unintended the function is
- Re-work quality
- Re-work ingenuity
- Weirdness

As usual, any and all actions that impress the judges have the potential to cause exceptions and additional points.

Details will be continue to be posted here. Check back for more information as DEF CON approaches.
