Have you taken your IoT toaster and created a remote activated fire-alarm tester? How about that old toy your kids (right, it was for the kids?) don't play with anymore that now fuzzes your neighbor's drone? The Hardware Hacking Village is hosting a "Make Your 0wn Use" contest. This is the place to show off your skills at repurposing the electronics that surround and engulf us daily.

#### The scoring will be based on the following:
- How bent / changed / different / unintended the function is
- Re-work quality
- Re-work ingenuity
- Weirdness

As usual, any and all actions that impress the judges have the potential to cause exceptions and additional points.

Details will be continue to be posted here. Check back for more information as DEF CON approaches.
