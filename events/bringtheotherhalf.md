If you only have half of a project, what good is it? It has been said that software is eating the world, but what good is that software without the other half, the hardware. The HHV will be presenting you with a compiled firmware, and your job will be to make something cool happen with that firmware.

Details on the chipset the binary is for will be released on May 11th, 2022. That will give you 3 months to plan, obtain and assemble your hardware thing. More details about the firmware (including a beta version of it) will be released leading up to the CON. Final firmware will available to load on-site at the HHV. 

#### The scoring will be based on the following:
* Originality of device 
* Purpose and possible use of device
* The extent that is uses the firmware (more features used = greater value) 

As usual, any and all actions that impress the judges have the potential to cause exceptions and additional points.

Details will be continue to be posted here. Check back for more information as DEF CON approaches.
