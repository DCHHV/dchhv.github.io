In addition to our hardware based challenges, we sometimes put together some logic puzzles that are rooted in the world of hardware. The advantage of these is they can be completed without real hardware. Either through simulation, signal analysis, or representations of hardware. Each challenge is different and offers a unique theme. Happy hacking!
