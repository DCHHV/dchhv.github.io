In addition to our hardware based challenges, we sometimes put together some logic puzzles that are rooted in the world of hardware. The advantage of these is they can be completed without real hardware. Either through simulation, signal analysis, or representations of hardware. Each challenge is different and offers a unique theme. Happy hacking!

## DEF CON 32 Challenge
This year's CTF is powered by Hack The Box ([https://www.hackthebox.com/](https://www.hackthebox.com/)).

In a dystopian cyberpunk future, the megacity of Neon Nexus is dominated by CyberCorp, a leading corporation known for its cutting-edge cybernetic augmentation modules. Recently, CyberCorp introduced their latest batch of enhancements, which quickly became popular due to their advanced AI capabilities. However, unbeknownst to the public, these enhancements contain a critical defect, purposefully introduced by the corporation. This defect triggers a condition known as "cyberpsychosis" in its users, causing them to lose control over their actions. As users succumb to this state, their AI-augmented cybernetic enhancements begin to take over, dictating their every move.

## DEF CON 30 Challenge
HHV Technologies, the inovation side of the Hardware Hacking Village, has been working hard on developing a new SOC, specifically for controlling electronic conference badges, called the HHVDC30. They provided us with a few "Badge" prototypes, and they're particularly proud of their new SAO power control functionality. They say this new chip design and DRM implementation should be perfect, but here in the hacking department, we're not so naive. Let's find some bugs and prove those arrogrants engineers wrong?

## DEF CON 28 Challenge
This challenge consists of 5 parts that range in difficulty. It is not necessary to complete them in any specific order, but doing so might help with the progression between them. Additionally, each challenge has some related text that might be useful on the path to the solution.
