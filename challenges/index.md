In addition to our hardware based challenges, we sometimes put together some logic puzzles that are rooted in the world of hardware. The advantage of these is they can be completed without real hardware. Either through simulation, signal analysis, or representations of hardware. Each challenge is different and offers a unique theme. Happy hacking!

## DEF CON 30 Challenge
We been working on developing a new SOC, the HHVDC30, to drive our new "Badge" prototype and enforce our new SAO DRM protocol. This new chip design and DRM implementation should be perfect, but the higher-ups still want us to test it out at DEF CON. Good luck finding any flaws!

## DEF CON 28 Challenge
This challenge consists of 5 parts that range in difficulty. It is not necessary to complete them in any specific order, but doing so might help with the progression between them. Additionally, each challenge has some related text that might be useful on the path to the solution.
