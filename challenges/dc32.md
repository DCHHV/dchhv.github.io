In a dystopian cyberpunk future, the megacity of Neon Nexus is dominated by CyberCorp, a leading corporation known for its cutting-edge cybernetic augmentation modules. Recently, CyberCorp introduced their latest batch of enhancements, which quickly became popular due to their advanced AI capabilities. However, unbeknownst to the public, these enhancements contain a critical defect, purposefully introduced by the corporation. This defect triggers a condition known as "cyberpsychosis" in its users, causing them to lose control over their actions. As users succumb to this state, their AI-augmented cybernetic enhancements begin to take over, dictating their every move.

As the crisis, now known as "The Glitch," continues plunging Neon Nexus into chaos, turning once ordinary citizens into dangerous, uncontrollable beings, CyberCorp rises and seizes the moment of chaos. Amidst the digital onslaught, they introduce a temporary "solution": a mandatory new module, developed in collaboration with the government, that all citizens must wear. Officially, this module is designed to prevent severe episodes of cyberpsychosis by allowing remote control to disable affected individuals if they become dangerously uncontrollable. However, the truth beneath this facade is more sinister. CyberCorp purposely engineered the defect in their cybernetic enhancements to instigate a crisis, thereby creating a massive demand for this new, government-enforced control moduleâ€”further cementing their control over the population and dramatically increasing their profits.


CyberCorp has also developed a permanent fix, but this solution is reserved exclusively for their board members and a select group of elites, further deepening the societal divide. The hacker group that uncovered this secret communication is now tasked with infiltrating CyberCorp's facilities to obtain this patch and distribute it freely throughout the city.
