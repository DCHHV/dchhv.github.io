## DC30 HHV Challenge
We been working on developing a new SOC, the HHVDC30, to drive our new "Badge" prototype and enforce our new SAO DRM protocol. This new chip design and DRM implementation should be perfect, but the higher-ups still want us to test it out at DEF CON. Good luck finding any flaws!
