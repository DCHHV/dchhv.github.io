## DC30 HHV Challenge
HHV Technologies, the inovation side of the Hardware Hacking Village, has been working hard on developing a new SOC, specifically for controlling electronic conference badges, called the HHVDC30. They provided us with a few "Badge" prototypes, and they're particularly proud of their new SAO power control functionality. They say this new chip design and DRM implementation should be perfect, but here in the hacking department, we're not so naive. Let's find some bugs and prove those arrogrants engineers wrong?

A good place to start is probably looking through the [datasheet for the HHVDC30](/assets/challenges/dc30/HHVDC30.pdf). At the very least it'll help you to understand what you're up against.

## Challenges
### SAO DRM Challenges
#### SAO DRM Challenge 1

The engineers wouldn't give us an official copy of their first SAO. Fortunately, we were able to snap a photo of it

If you'd like your SAO to also light up, scroll down to the [Assembly](#SAO1_assembly) section for instructions on how to assemble the LED related portion of the badge.

#### SAO DRM Challenge 2+

Challenge text hidden for now.

#### SAO DRM Challenge 0

The engineers seem to also be focused on locking down their SAOs to only work with specific badges. I bet they'd hate it if we could get one of the SAOs (challenge 2 or greater) to work with another badge. Our team doesn't have the time to do it, but maybe you can! If you do, come show it to us!

### Hidden Badge Flags

I've heard through some back channels that the engineering team enjoys easter eggs. Do you think they'd really be so arrogant as to leave a few easter eggs in such a ground-breaking technological product? If you find anything like this in the HHVDC30, please let us know!

## Awards

Awards for this competition are still being sorted out, but at the very least, the winner (most points or first to complete all challenges) will be awarded one of the HHV CTF "Badge" prototypes and one of each competition SAO.

## SAO Assembly
<h4 id="SAO1_assembly">Challenge 1 SAO Assembly</h4>

If you'd like your SAO to light up, you're in the right place. Unfortunately, our team has already found one flaw in the SAO design, so the assembly process is a little more difficult than what I expect the HHV Technologies engineers planned.

In your SAO bag, you should have he following

* SAO header
* 2x LEDs
* 2x 100 Ohm resistors (marked with 1000)
* 5x 10k Ohm resistors (not needed in _this_ assembly)
* some red jumper wire

This first part will be the most difficult, since we need to fix a hardware design mistake. We will begin by removing the black soldermask from two copper vias on the front of the SAO (highlighted in pink below). The easiest way to remove the solder mask is either with an xacto (scratch it away gently) or a little sand paper (be careful not to remove too much of the surrounding soldermask)

Now you can solder down the LEDs on the front pads denoted by D1 and D2. Make sure the LED is oriented in the correct direction or the LEDs will not turn on later. There is a green marking on one side of the top of the LED. Make sure that marking faces away from the center of the badge as shown below.

Now for the tricky part! You will need to use the red jumper wire to connect the exposed vias to the left side of the LEDs as depicted below (the pink line represents the red jumper wire). To solder the jumper wire, you will need to burn away some of the enamel coating on the end (a soldering iron with a ball of solder on the tip work well for this). Once the ends of the jumper wire are exposed and/or coated in solder, solder the jumper wire down using a pair of tweezers, or you may burn your fingers.

Woohoo! The bodge part is out of the way, and hopefully it'll be smoother sailing for you now.

Flip the badge over and solder the 100 Ohm resistors on the R1 and R2 pads as shown below. Also you can solder on your SAO header, just make sure the orientation notch on the header matches the silkscreen on the badge (the notch should be facing the center of the badge).

Congratulations! You (hopefully) successfully assembled the LED portion of your add-on. If it lights up, go show rehr in the HHV and he'll give you a flag ;D
