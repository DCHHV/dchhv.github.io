## Hackfest 2020 HHV Challenge
We're back with a new challenge for Hackfest 2020! We hope this challenge will lead you to uncover a new tool, or learn how to use an old tool in a new way! A dissassembler is a great tool to have in your hacker toolbelt, and reversing microcontoller firmware is a fantastic way to learn how to use it!

This is part of a series of challenges, you can find the [first 5 challenges here](https://dchhv.org/challenges/dc28.html)! If you're curious about the other HHV happenings as part of Hackfest, you can find the schedule at (https://hackfest.ca/en/villages/hardwarehacking/).

Good luck, and most importantly, have fun! If you've enjoyed these and/or have ideas for future HHV challenges, please reach out! We'd love to have more collaborators for next year!

### Challenge 6
These small devices seem to be all over. The latest is much smaller, but encased in some sort of epoxy, so we're unable to access the traces to the 7-segment display. As expected, the display is flashing far too fast for us to read, BUT while analyzing the device, we could make out ATTiny84 on the IC label, and there was a debug port in which we were able to dump the firmware! Can you help us figure out what was on that 7-segment display?
