## DC33 HHV Challenge

We're excited to bring back the HHV CTF for DC33!

In preparation for the event, here are a few things we recommend you bring:

* 3V3 IO compatible programmable device
  * Our challenges are not 5V compatible, so no Arduino UNOs!
* Something to probe digital signals
  * A USB-to-serial adapter is just the tip of the iceberg
* Jumper wires/mini-grabbers/aligator clips
* HHV will have soldering irons (first come, first served), but you can always bring your own!
  * ...maybe a pair of tweezers too

### We'll see you soon in Vegas!
