Get Ready for the DEF CON 32 Hardware Hacking Village CTF!

We're thrilled to announce that the DEF CON Hardware Hacking Village Capture the Flag (CTF) competition is returning and will kick off in just over a week! Whether you're a seasoned hardware hacker or new to the scene, this is the perfect opportunity to test your skills and learn from the best in the community. This year CTF will consist of two parts:

* Online Hardware challenges: 
  * Logic Captures of real hardware devices
  * Simulated hardware that the users must interact with and exploit them.

* Physical Hardware challenges 
  * PCB Reverse engineering
  * PCB assembly

To ensure you're fully prepared for the diverse challenges ahead, we've put together a recommended list of supplies and tools that might come in handy:

* Computer/laptop
* Logic 2 software
* Microcontroller/development board with 3.3 V I/O
* An Arduino-compatible board 
* Logic analyzer
* UART to TTL converter (3.3 V)
* Soldering iron
  * Note: We do provide irons, but they are first come, first served
* Multimeter

* Breadboard
* Jumper wires

This is not a complete list, and it’s not guaranteed you’ll use all these supplies. These things have traditionally been useful for solving our challenges, so we suggest them. We’ll try to have some of these supplies available for participants, but we cannot guarantee anything.
