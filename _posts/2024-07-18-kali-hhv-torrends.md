With DEF CON 32 quickly approaching, we've locked in to place our official Kali HHV live images and have begun distribution via bittorrent. If you are unfamilar or unaware of this, we've forked Offensive Security's Kali Linux image builder. We used this opportunity to cram as much hardware hacking goodness that we could in to bootable live image. And, since it's based on the existing Kali Linux framework, it has all of the features one would expect from a security focused live CD.

Interested in building your own, suggest new packages, add more packages, or just want to learn more about this project? You can find the source repo [here](https://github.com/DCHHV/kali-live-build-config).

Note that we will keep seeding these torrents up until and through DEF CON. After closing ceremonies however, they can disappear any time.

## HHV
The HHV variant is a customized Kali variant created by us. It uses XFCE4 as the GUI. It includes all of the standard Kali boot features (memtest, live, live forensic modeu etc.), all of the WiFi device firmware that is in kali-rolling at time of build, and a whole lot of utilities for hardware and embedded device hacking. It weighs in at about 3.8 GB, so it fits nicely on a standard DVD or 4 GB USB flash drive with room to spare. We built both i386 and amd64 CPU variants and have made torrents of them available below.
