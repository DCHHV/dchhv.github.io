DEF CON 30 is fast approaching! We are busy working on details! This year's theme of Homecoming has cast our minds back to the start of the HHV, where everything that happened was because attendees (read members of our community) brought cool things to share. We always have enjoyed and encouraged the awesome items that the tools and skills that the HHV provides and helps develop result in. 

In order to bring that homespun goodness back into center stage, we are excited to announce a number of new activities and contests to participate in.

### [Make Your 0wn Use](/events/makeyourownuse.html)
* Re-worked, re-purposed and beautiful. Bring your devices that have had your own flavor mixed in, and show it off, with a chance to win prizes. 

### [HHV Rube Goldberg Machine](/events/hhv_rgb.html)
* Have you ever wondered what the most random and fun way to get bits from one place to another is? We have, and this is a chance for you to build a module or two to add to the string of devices passing the signal to the EOF.

### [Bring the Other Half](/events/bringtheotherhalf.html)
* Software is eating the world, but really it isn't that great without the other half, hardware. We provide a firmware. You bring the device and define what that firmware will actually do.

Each of these are designed to help you explore and share that hardware mad scientist side. We are giving you some heads up so that you can plan and bring awesomeness.

We are looking forward to hearing about your progress, and to seeing what you bring!

There will be more information and activities to come. Keep your eyes on [twitter](https://twitter.com/DC_HHV), [DEF CON Forums](https://forum.defcon.org/node/239785), and here as the CON approaches.
