We are proud to be hosting another round of Robo Sumo this year. We have posted the <a href="\robosumo.html">rules for this year</a>.

We are also putting in a category for Hebocon. This being DEFCON I am sure there are all kinds of things just need a couple of servos and some wiring and they would be ready for the ring.

Last year robo sumo rounds started on Friday around noon. We will be moving that back a bit, to mid afternoon. The ring available all of the weekend for experimentation and play. Weigh ins and size check time will be announced at the con, but the equipment will be available starting Friday morning for those that want to check where they sit.

Those of you who have trouble with some items and the TSA (you know who you are), we will have a couple of out of the box Zumo bots from Polulu to available to participate with. Last year's champion borrowed a laptop and programmed a borrowed host with some sample code, strapped a wall wart to the top for weight and marched to victory. You too could join these ranks of greatness!

Hebocon will be Saturday afternoon. We are excited to see what you can come up with.
