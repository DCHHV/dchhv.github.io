## Meetup Schedule
With DEF CON 28 Safe Mode, we're adding a heavy focus on meetups. Where there is either a led discusson or an open group of people with a common interest. These take place in both text and voice chat. Some of them are repeated multiple times throughout DEF CON 28 Safe Mode in order to allow attendees from around the world to participate. While not all are repeated, we encourage you to continue the conversations.

### Learn To Solder The Badgebuddy Kit
Joseph Long (hwbxr)
#### Abstract
As part of an ongoing educational mission, HackerBoxes usually gives away thousands of little solder kits at DEF CON.  For DEF CON 28 SAFE MODE, a special edition BadgeBuddy soldering kit has been designed.  While still free (as in beer), there will be a $1 charge for DC28 SAFE MODE to cover shipping the kit anywhere in the United States.

The BadgeBuddy is a simple and fun kit to introduce basic soldering skills. Once assembled, the blinky mini-badge PCB can be hung from a conference lanyard, backpack, purse, belt, etc using the included bead-chain. The BadgeBuddy uses an improved style of self-cycling rainbow LEDs for a reduced BOM with no external control circuitry required. This makes for an interesting result that is still simple enough for a first time soldering project.

The BadgeBuddy Solder Kits can be obtained at HackerBoxes.com and will ship starting on July 20 for delivery by DC28.  During DC28 SAFE MODE, a live video workshop will allow participants to work together as a group, possibly setting a world record for group building of a solder kit.  For those who do not have soldering tools on hand, HackerBoxes has made a set of basic soldering tools available at cost.

### Hardware Hacking 101: There Is Plenty Of Room At The Bottom
Federico Lucifredi
#### Abstract
This is a live demonstration of hacking into the processor embedded in an SD card, effectively turning the device into a potentially covert Raspberry Pi-class computer under your complete control. The ARM926EJ-S ARM processor made its appearance as the embedded CPU in Transcend’s WiFi-enabled SD cards, clocking in at an impressive 426 BogoMips – we can’t possibly leave that territory unexplored, can we?

In this session we root the card’s own CPU, install a more featureful OS, and explore the system’s common and unusual capabilities (in hardware AES encryption and native support for Java bytecode among them). These provide plenty of building blocks for our projects.

Clearly, complete control of such a hidden computer running with full network connectivity can be used in network penetration scenarios. We’ll discuss applicable security threat countermeasures.

There is plenty of room at the bottom, and opening these computer-within-the computer configurations create interesting miniaturized automation scenarios alongside the obvious, more ominous security aspects.

Use your newfound knowledge for good, with great power comes great responsibility!

### Onkeypress=Hack();
Luis Angel Ramirez Mendoza Secondary Speaker: Mauro Eldritch
#### Abstract
In this talk we will see the assembly and use of a modified BadUSB keyboard with an integrated DIY physical keylogger.
Using a built-in WiFi module, this keyboard is capable of sending user keystrokes to a remote server and storing it in a database.
Both the piece by piece assembly, its diagram, and its programming will be demonstrated. Also there will also be a live demo to demonstrate its operation.

This talk is recommended for both novice and experienced users alike.

### HackerBox 0057 Build Session
Joseph Long (hwbxr)
#### Abstract
"Build HackerBox 0057 to explore microcontroller programming, IoT WiFi exploits, Bluetooth control, IR hacks, lockpicking tools, audio/video signaling, and more.  HackerBoxes are the monthly subscription box for DIY electronics and computer technology.  Each monthly HackerBox is a surprise.  But this month the cathode is out of the bag, so to speak.  The theme is SAFE MODE.

There will be an indie badge kit featuring dual core ESP32, IPS full-color 240x135 display, AV out, IR in/out, micro joystick, USB-C interface, battery charger, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and it's Arduino programmable.  Of course there will be swag galore.  HackerBox 0057 will bring home a ""village"" of IoT, Wireless, Lockpicking, and of course Hardware Hacking that should not disappoint.

Monthly HackerBoxes usually ship around the last day of the month.  However, SAFE MODE HackerBox 0057 will ship a few days early (for both existing a new members) and should be received in time for DEF CON 28 SAFE MODE.  We recommend ordering by July 22, but earlier is always better in light of recent postal delays."
