## Meetup Schedule
With DEF CON 28 Safe Mode, we’re introducing a new-old idea, meetups. We have found over the years that some of the best content in our village came about organically. A couple of like minded hackers happened to be in the same place when the right topic came up, and suddenly a ton of good information is flying around and a crowd is assembling. Rather than wait for these random events, we thought we could create a space and a time for specific topics and see how it goes.

In some cases we have someone with interest to seed the discussion, others there is just a topic and an invite for people with a common interest. These take place in both text and voice chat. Some of them are repeated multiple times throughout DEF CON 28 Safe Mode in order to allow attendees from around the world to participate. While not all are repeated, we encourage you to continue the conversations. The meetup is a nexus for finding and starting the conversation. A place to meet people with the same interests or challenges and discuss. Bring your expertise and your questions.

## Meetup Details
* * *
### Some HHV Challenges
Rob Rehr
#### Description
HHV members have created a few challenges for this year's DEF CON. Come learn and chat about those challenges, or bring new challenges to share with the community. This time will start with an introduction to this year's HHV challenges, but the remaining time will be open to community questions and conversations
* * *
### PCB Proto and Rework
ShortTie
#### Description
Have any tips for making it through the initial PCB process? Does that part being the wrong orientation really mean you have to wait weeks for a new PCB? What are the checks you do when getting that first draft ready for fabrication? How do you keep track of versioning and component availability?
* * *
### Legacy Hardware
ShortTie
#### Description
Old computers don’t die, well at least in some skilled hands. Keeping old machines alive can mean some clever part sourcing, some interesting reinvention of functionality with newer components, and arcane knowledge of the oddities of the individual platform. Some do it for fun, some for a living. What equipment do you keep working? How do you address the stresses that come with age? Any pictures of the setup you maintain?
* * *
### 3H: Hardware Happy Hour
Chris Gammell
#### Description
Wind down the first official day of DEF CON Safe Mode talking about hardware! Bring a project to share! All hardware projects are welcome, from a simple Arduino based thingamabob to your company's newest hardware product (and how you earn your living). The main focus is meeting like minded people who are building fun things!
* * *
### Sourcing Parts
bombnav
#### Description
Sourcing parts in the COVID involves new challenges due to supply chain issues.  Counterfeiting continues to be a problem with out of production parts.  This meetup is designed to share ideas and sources for acquiring parts for electronic hobbyists.
* * *
### OSS ASIC
Josh Marks
#### Description
Come geek out about the new Google + efabless + Skywater 130 nm Process Design Kit that was recently released. Brainstorm IC design ideas for the free fab runs in November and in 2021 — an extraordinary value!! No ASIC knowledge? No problem — casual conversation about transistor structures, and basic circuit architectures included.
* * *
### Certification Processes (UL, FCC, etc.)
ShortTie
#### Description
Getting a product to market can include a long walk in the nearly unknown dark drama of certifications. Getting the right version of the prototype through the right stages is a mystery to all but the few that face that hurtle consistently. What certificates are needed for what kinds of markets? How do you handle testing on prototypes where functionality is still evolving? How do you make sure your equipment is ready for the rigors of the process? Any horror stories to share? Lessons to learn from?
* * *
### Wearables
ShortTie
#### Description
Wearable compute has some interesting challenges. They need to be light, flexible, resilient and often times the messy parts need to be hidden. They can be purely for show, like LED earrings. Hi-tech functionality, like discreet surveillance equipment. Or high functioning, like a connected watch or sensor grid for monitoring. How do you power your setup? How do you launder it? How do you keep it from catching fire or burning the wearer?

### Learn To Solder The Badgebuddy Kit
Joseph Long (hwbxr) @HackerBoxes
#### Abstract
As part of an ongoing educational mission, HackerBoxes usually gives away thousands of little solder kits at DEF CON.  For DEF CON 28 SAFE MODE, a special edition BadgeBuddy soldering kit has been designed.  While still free (as in beer), there will be a $1 charge for DC28 SAFE MODE to cover shipping the kit anywhere in the United States.

The BadgeBuddy is a simple and fun kit to introduce basic soldering skills. Once assembled, the blinky mini-badge PCB can be hung from a conference lanyard, backpack, purse, belt, etc using the included bead-chain. The BadgeBuddy uses an improved style of self-cycling rainbow LEDs for a reduced BOM with no external control circuitry required. This makes for an interesting result that is still simple enough for a first time soldering project.

The BadgeBuddy Solder Kits can be obtained at HackerBoxes.com and will ship starting on July 20 for delivery by DC28.  During DC28 SAFE MODE, a live video workshop will allow participants to work together as a group, possibly setting a world record for group building of a solder kit.  For those who do not have soldering tools on hand, HackerBoxes has made a set of basic soldering tools available at cost.

### Hardware Hacking 101: There Is Plenty Of Room At The Bottom
Federico Lucifredi (@0xF2)
#### Abstract
This is a live demonstration of hacking into the processor embedded in an SD card, effectively turning the device into a potentially covert Raspberry Pi-class computer under your complete control. The ARM926EJ-S ARM processor made its appearance as the embedded CPU in Transcend’s WiFi-enabled SD cards, clocking in at an impressive 426 BogoMips – we can’t possibly leave that territory unexplored, can we?

In this session we root the card’s own CPU, install a more featureful OS, and explore the system’s common and unusual capabilities (in hardware AES encryption and native support for Java bytecode among them). These provide plenty of building blocks for our projects.

Clearly, complete control of such a hidden computer running with full network connectivity can be used in network penetration scenarios. We’ll discuss applicable security threat countermeasures.

There is plenty of room at the bottom, and opening these computer-within-the computer configurations create interesting miniaturized automation scenarios alongside the obvious, more ominous security aspects.

Use your newfound knowledge for good, with great power comes great responsibility!

### Onkeypress=Hack();
Mauro Cáseres (@mauroeldritch), Farith Pérez Sáez (@f_perezs), and Luis Ángel Ramírez Mendoza (@larm182luis)
#### Abstract
In this talk we will see the assembly and use of a modified BadUSB keyboard with an integrated DIY physical keylogger.
Using a built-in WiFi module, this keyboard is capable of sending user keystrokes to a remote server and storing it in a database.
Both the piece by piece assembly, its diagram, and its programming will be demonstrated. Also there will also be a live demo to demonstrate its operation.

This talk is recommended for both novice and experienced users alike.

### HackerBox 0057 Build Session
Joseph Long (hwbxr) @HackerBoxes
#### Abstract
"Build HackerBox 0057 to explore microcontroller programming, IoT WiFi exploits, Bluetooth control, IR hacks, lockpicking tools, audio/video signaling, and more.  HackerBoxes are the monthly subscription box for DIY electronics and computer technology.  Each monthly HackerBox is a surprise.  But this month the cathode is out of the bag, so to speak.  The theme is SAFE MODE.

There will be an indie badge kit featuring dual core ESP32, IPS full-color 240x135 display, AV out, IR in/out, micro joystick, USB-C interface, battery charger, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and it's Arduino programmable.  Of course there will be swag galore.  HackerBox 0057 will bring home a ""village"" of IoT, Wireless, Lockpicking, and of course Hardware Hacking that should not disappoint.

Monthly HackerBoxes usually ship around the last day of the month.  However, SAFE MODE HackerBox 0057 will ship a few days early (for both existing a new members) and should be received in time for DEF CON 28 SAFE MODE.  We recommend ordering by July 22, but earlier is always better in light of recent postal delays."
