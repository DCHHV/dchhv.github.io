### Custom, Cheap, Easy, And Safe Badges - Without Starting From Scratch
securelyfitz
#### Abstract
Electronic conference badges are cool and everything, but they're A LOT of time, money, and effort including but not limited to hardware, software and art design, testing, manufacturing, testing, provisioning, and repairing.

I'll share OpenTaxus, a relatively simple, cheap, mass-producible, and open-source badge design. We'll start out by looking at and understanding the design and implementation, highlighting the areas worth customizing (and which to leave as-s). I'll do a walkthrough of a few changes to customize the design - in KiCAD for hardware changes, and in CircuitPython for software changes.

We'll wrap up with some discussion of how to handle cost reduction to fit in a certain budget, manage badge logistics for events of different sizes, and warn about some of the many pitfalls that electronic badges suffer. You should walk away with the ability to customize a badge to be mass produced for your own event.

### The Wild And Wonderful World Of Early Microprocessors With A Focus On The 6502
Michael Brown
#### Abstract
Today everyone's computers either run an Intel, AMD, or ARM processor.  And most don't even know what particular one they have.  I know *I* don't.
But back in the 70s and 80s, computer hobbyists knew they had a Z80 or a 6502 or 6809 or 68000 or other processor, and there was a much wider range of processors that existed in a wide range of systems.  
So this will be a lesson in microprocessor history of the 8-bit and early 16-bit systems, with a particular focus on the 6502.  We will delve into what made these systems what they are, and we will delve into how people can get into working with 8-bit microprocessors once again with resources for knowledge and systems.
We will have a couple of these on hand as well.

### All Your Keyboards Are Belong To Us!
Federico Lucifredi
#### Abstract
This is a live tutorial of hacking against keyboards of all forms. Attacking the keyboard is the ultimate strategy to hijack a session before it is encrypted, capturing plaintext at the source and (often) in much simpler ways than those required to attack network protocols. 

In this session we explore available attack vectors against traditional keyboards, starting with plain old keyloggers. We then advance to "Van Eck Phreaking" style attacks against individual keystroke emanations as well as RF wireless connections, and we finally graduate to the new hotness: acoustic attacks by eavesdropping on the sound of you typing! 

Use your newfound knowledge for good, with great power comes great responsibility!

A subset of signal leak attacks focusing on keyboards. This talk is compiled with open sources, no classified material will be discussed.

### Taking Off The Blindfold: Detecting Persistent Threats On Draytek Edge Devices
Octavio Gianatiempo Gastón Aznarez
#### Abstract
Advanced attackers are increasingly choosing edge devices as targets, many of which are security appliances such as VPNs and Firewalls. They run closed-source firmware, and defenders and researchers must understand it to assess its security and integrity. We faced this firsthand when a client that used Draytek equipment was compromised. With at least 500k Draytek routers exposed to the Internet globally, no working tools exist to extract their firmware and assist researchers and defenders working with them.
We reverse-engineered Draytek's firmware format, developed tools to extract it, and discovered that its RTOS kernel can load code modules dynamically. These stored modules remain active even after firmware upgrades, inadvertently facilitating persistent threats. We crafted and uploaded malicious modules using our tools and newly found vulnerabilities to achieve persistence.
End-users lack straightforward means to detect such compromises. In response to this threat, we developed our own module to assess the integrity of other modules loaded in memory, mitigating its impact. In our pursuit of a more secure internet, we are sharing our knowledge and opening our tools to the community, enabling observability, hardening, transparency, and vulnerability research on Draytek edge devices.

Octavio Gianatiempo is a Security Researcher at Faraday and a Computer Science student at the University of Buenos Aires. He's also a biologist with research experience in molecular biology and neuroscience. The necessity of analyzing complex biological data was his point of entry into programming. However, he wanted to gain a deeper understanding of how computers work, so he enrolled in Computer Science. As a Security Researcher at Faraday, he focuses on vulnerability research on IoT and embedded devices and fuzzing open and closed-source software to find new vulnerabilities and exploit them. He has presented his findings at various conferences, including DEFCON, Ekoparty, 8.8, and Nerdearla.

Gastón Aznarez is a computer enthusiast who is passionate about cybersecurity. He earned a degree in Computer Science and began working in malware detection in firmware. He currently works as a Security Researcher at Faraday, specializing in discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT and embedded devices. Gastón also participates in CTF competitions and has shared his expertise as a speaker at different conferences.
