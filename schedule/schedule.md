## Meetup Schedule

We have found over the years that some of the best content in our village came about organically. A couple of like minded hackers happened to be in the same place when the right topic came up, and suddenly a ton of good information is flying around and a crowd is assembling. Rather than wait for these random events, we thought we could create a space and a time for specific topics and see how it goes.

In some cases we have someone with interest to seed the discussion, others there is just a topic and an invite for people with a common interest. These take place in both text and voice chat. Some of them are repeated multiple times throughout DEF CON 29 in order to allow attendees from around the world to participate. While not all are repeated, we encourage you to continue the conversations. The meetup is a nexus for finding and starting the conversation. A place to meet people with the same interests or challenges and discuss. Bring your expertise and your questions.

## Talk/Workshop Details



### Hardware Hacking 101: Rogue Keyboards and Eavesdropping Cables	

Federico Lucifredi	

#### Abstract

This is a live tutorial of hacking with keystroke injection attacks. We take advantage of the inherent trust that computers place on what is believed to be a regular keyboard to unleash pre-programmed keystroke payloads at well over 1000 words a minute. We access the host system and bypass traditional security countermeasures for payloads that can include reverse shells, binary injection, brute force password attacks, and just about any attack that can be fully automated.  

We misuse the trust the operating system places on USB human-interaction devices to demonstrate once again the old adage that if you can physically access a computing device, there is no real security to be had. I will review hardware, its capabilities, how to breach OS security, and how attackers can enable it to perform a variety of tasks with its own tools. I will then show how to build and install additional software and customize the device with binary or scripted payloads.

We take the discussion to the next level by removing the need for a device and exploring attacks that can be delivered directly by a plain USB cable. We dissect easily-sourced, low-cost hardware implants embedded in standard, innocent-looking USB cables providing an attacker with further capabilities, including among them the ability to track its own geolocation.

#### Bio

Federico Lucifredi is the Product Management Director for Ceph Storage at Red Hat and a co-author of O'Reilly's ""Peccary Book"" on AWS System Administration. Previously, he was the Ubuntu Server product manager at Canonical, where he oversaw a broad portfolio and the rise of Ubuntu Server to the rank of most popular OS on Amazon AWS. A software engineer-turned-manager at the Novell corporation, he was part of the SUSE Linux team, overseeing the update lifecycle and delivery stack of a $150 million maintenance business. A CIO and a network software architect at advanced technology and embedded Linux startups, Federico was also a lecturer for over 200 students in Boston University's graduate and undergraduate programs, and simultaneously a consultant for MIT implementing fluid-dynamics simulations in Java.

### Use a PortaProg to flash, dump, and test ISP and UPDI chips	

Bradán Lane, Sara Cladlow	

#### Abstract

What is a PortaProg and why would I use it? You can use the PortaProg for flashing firmware to a wide range of Atmel chips using the ISP or UPDI interfaces. It can also read/write FUSES, and access EEPROM. It can flash a chip interactively during development or from its on-board SPIFFS storage at the bench or in the field. The talk will demonstrate it being used for rapid programming of ATTiny badges, performing an update to an ATMega device in the field, and dumping the firmware from an Ardiuno based device without a computer. You will also see how the PortProg has spawned a 3D printed plug-and-play test jig design .... or just attend to see if the demos crash and burn.	

#### Bio

Bradán Lane is a UX Design and User Researcher who had his own ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" experience when he discovered badge making. While he has made a number of fun blinky beepy ornaments and badges, his found his passion with the 2020 eChallengeCoin - an interactive and text story challenge puzzle. To help with his development, he created the PortableISP. The 2021 eChallengeCoin required a new chip which precipitated the creation of the PortaProg which serves as both his development tool an his production and test device.

### The Black Box and the Brain Box:  When Electronics and Deception Collide	

Gigs	

#### Abstract

Electricity has, from the earliest history of man, been seen as an almost mystical force.  From Thor's lightning onward, various individuals and groups have used electricity and electrical devices to baffle, mystify, mislead, and control people.  In the modern day, this practice continues in the form of polygraph, questionable uses of fMRI and EEG, and other high-tech props intended to dazzle the victim or lend a technological veneer of credibility to the user.   This talk will focus on the history and current applications of deception by and with electrical and electronic devices.	"Gigs is the founder of ##electronics on Freenode (may it rest in peace), and a long time electronics enthusiast and DEF CON HHV volunteer.  He, working with see_ess, did the PCB and hardware design for this year's TorBadge, a mini-polygraph device.

### Walkthrough of DC 28 HHV Challenges	

rehr	

#### Abstract

Last year we (the HHV) released a series of hardware hacking challenges for DEF CON attendees to solve during the conference (and after). Many attempted the challenges, but only a few (3) solved all 5! Join us as we will walk through how to solve all 5 of the DC 28 HHV challenges, and attempt to demystify the world of hardware hacking. We may even drop a hint or two for this years' challenges.	

#### Bio

Rehr is an electrical engineering, and long-time Hardware Hacking Village volunteer. He enjoys teaching and creating challenges that help grow and challenge the hardware hacking community.

### A Lazy r2 Solve of @mediumrehr Challenge 6	

Ben Gardiner (0xstatic)	

#### Abstract

Join Ben for an informal let's play of @mediumrehr's Hardware Hacking Village challenge 6. Some topics we will cover include: radare2 , AVR assembly, 7 segment displays, and sigrok. It should be fun and relaxed with plenty of time to stop and re-do some steps if something needs more deliberation. See you there.	

#### Bio

Mr. Gardiner is an independent consultant at Yellow Flag Security, Inc. presently working to secure heavy vehicles at the NMFTA. With more than ten years of professional experience in embedded systems design and a lifetime of hacking experience, Gardiner has a deep knowledge of the low-level functions of operating systems and the hardware with which they interface. Prior YFS Inc. and joining the NMFTA team in 2019, Mr. Gardiner held security assurance and reversing roles at a global corporation, as well as worked in embedded software and systems engineering roles at several organizations. He holds a M.Sc. Eng. in Applied Math & Stats from Queen’s University. He is a DEF CON Hardware Hacking Village (DC HHV) and Car Hacking Village (CHV) volunteer.
